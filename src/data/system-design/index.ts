/**
 * The System Design track.
 *
 * Ordered so each section can only use vocabulary the previous ones
 * established: you cannot discuss replication lag before latency, or CAP
 * before replication, or service boundaries before the cost of a network
 * call. That constraint is what stops a system-design course from becoming
 * a glossary.
 *
 * Reuses the Course/Section/Chapter models unchanged — `Track` has had
 * SYSTEM_DESIGN since Phase 1 and `listCourses` has always taken a track,
 * so this needed no schema change and no second reader.

    "Large systems are not built out of clever code. They are built out of a small number of components arranged to make specific trade-offs, and the skill is being able to say which trade-off you are making and why. This track builds the vocabulary first, then the components, then the arrangements — and every lesson's diagram is data you can read as text, not a picture.",
