/**
 * The DSA course.
 *
 * Ordered by dependency rather than by topic popularity: complexity analysis
 * comes first because every later chapter argues in its terms, and the
 * technique sections come after the structures they operate on.
 *
 * Sections 11 onward (trees, heaps, graphs, dynamic programming and the rest)
 * are planned but not written. The roadmap page shows only what exists.
