/**
 * The Low-Level Design track.
 *
 * Ordered so no section uses an idea an earlier one has not established:
 * responsibility and coupling first, because SOLID is those two wearing
 * hats; composition before patterns, because most patterns are
 * composition applied to a recurring problem; and the workflow last,
 * because it is the procedure that ties the rest together.
 *
 * Reuses Course/Section/Chapter unchanged — `Track` has had LLD since
 * Phase 1 and the reader became track-generic in Phase 7, so this needed
 * no schema change and no second reader.

    "Low-level design is the layer between 'which services exist' and 'which line runs': what types live inside one service, what each is responsible for, and how they reach each other. This track builds the vocabulary — responsibility, coupling, cohesion — then SOLID as special cases of it, then the patterns that are recurring answers to recurring problems. Every pattern is taught with the situation where it is the wrong choice.",
