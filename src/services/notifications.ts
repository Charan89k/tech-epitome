 * ever a prompt to buy anything, because there is nothing to buy.
 *

 *
 *   1. **Preferences are checked on write, not on read.** A learner who
 *      turned a kind off should not accumulate a backlog of hidden rows
 *      that all appear if they turn it back on.
 *   2. **`href` must be relative.** A notification is rendered as a link;
 *      one carrying an absolute URL would be an open redirect with a
 *      friendly label on it.
