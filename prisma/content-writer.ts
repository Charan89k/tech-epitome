/**

 * Idempotent: everything upserts on its natural key (course slug, section
 * slug within a course, chapter slug within a section, exercise slug), and
 * ordering comes from position, so appending a section or an exercise never
 * renumbers the ones before it. Learner progress and submissions reference
 * these rows by id and are untouched.

 * default for production, where an admin may have unpublished a chapter:
 * rewriting it from source would quietly publish it again. `created`
 * collects a label for every row actually created, for reporting.
